3," Have you ever looked at pictures of the Face on Mars and wondered what it could possibly be? A mountain range? A huge impact crater? A big hole in the ground?

Actually, no. It is much more likely to be a canyon. A canyon deep enough to drive a space shuttle through.

That is because the Face on Mars is not really a face at all. It is just a collection of cliffs and canyons that formed as water eroded the rock over millions of years. The cliffs form a “face” that is sometimes seen in pictures but that actually corresponds to a series of canyons cutting across older, higher rock, and leading to a valley with a shape that resembles an inverted V, or a “face.”

The reason we call these features a face is that people saw the shapes and thought “face.” This is a common occurrence with geology features on other planets. Astronomers and planetary scientists are always on the lookout for interesting shapes in the rocks that might resemble something familiar from home, whether from geology, geography, or even our cultural history.

There are many reasons scientists think these features are not a face. One reason is that the features are not symmetrical. If you were trying to make a face out of rocks, you would probably put more effort into making it symmetrical. Another is that the features are formed by the movement of water through the rock, which is a very slow process. It would have taken millions of years for the features to form, which means the rocks were not being changed very much each year. This means any patterns in the rocks would have had to have formed during the first million years or so, which is not a time frame in which rocks change quickly enough to form complex features like a face.

So the next time you look at pictures of the Face on Mars, remember – it’s a canyon! And if you want to explore your own imagination and that of planetary scientists even further, consider that canyons and other features on other planets might not be symmetric, or even resemble what we would naturally associate with terms like “face” or “mountain.”

232," Have you ever looked at the images returned by Mars rovers and wondered: is there life on Mars? While we can't answer that for sure, we can focus on the amazing details of the Face on Mars. 

This huge geological formation in the ancient dichotomy zone of Gale Crater was created by the wind and not by living organisms. It is a result of billions of years of sand blowing into a mountain. The shape and size of the Face on Mars are about 2,300 feet (or 700 meters) wide and 410 feet (or 125 meters) tall.

Scientists think that the winds in Mars' atmosphere are responsible for the formations. The air pressure on Mars is lower than on Earth, which means that the air moves more slowly. This causes the sand to pile up and create the amazing Face on Mars! The wind can pick up sand particles and create a wall of sand that gets higher and higher over time.

The Face on Mars also suggests that water was present in the region in the past. The presence of wind-driven sand dunes and the complexity of the Face indicate that the area had more extensive water flow and ejection of sediments, possibly related to the lake status of the crater floor.

So, the next time you see the Face on Mars, remember – it's not alive, but it tells us about the past of the Red Planet! The study of the Face on Mars and similar landforms on other planets helps scientists better understand the conditions of the planet and how it has changed over time.
